# Scripts

## `setup.sh`

Bootstraps the local Demucs ONNX model required by later separation work.

- **Input:** none
- **Prerequisites:** `curl`, `shasum`
- **Output:** `src-tauri/models/htdemucs_embedded.onnx`
- **Success:** downloads the model, verifies SHA-256, and stores it in the models directory
- **Repeat runs:** exit immediately if the existing model already matches the pinned checksum
- **Failure:** exits non-zero with a readable error if a required tool is missing, the download fails, or checksum verification fails

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
